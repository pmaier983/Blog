# Just a basic Express API

- Why not use Fastify?
  - Its actually [slow with bun](https://lemire.me/blog/2023/10/07/web-server-hello-world-benchmark-go-vs-node-js-vs-nim-vs-bun/) when i wrote this
- Why not use Bun.serve or Koa or...
  - Express has a large ecosystem and solid examples and documentation for every fringe use case you can think of. If I wanted speed I would not pick js for the api at all.
- Why not an even simple API structure
  - I am not building this to just have an API. I'm also curious what a "good" express api structure looks like. I will hopefully end this experiment with something I could use down the line in a pinch.
