# My Reflections on Astro

- [o1](https://openai.com/o1/) is surprisingly bad at generating accurate code for astro.
- I'm not sure how much I love the [Integrations](https://astro.build/integrations) side of things
- The speed of loading and care around bundle size is amazing!
- Annoying context switching between react and astro -> Causes issues (have to use lucide-react in astro files and lucid-react in react Component. Bad error messages to this order as well)
