# Phillip Maier's Blog V4

Tech/Tools I'm interested in using for this one:

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/)
  - Along with [Deno](https://deno.com/) this project attempts to bring speed and coherence to the javascript ecosystem. I chose it over Deno due to its faster speed, and the clarity of vision its [founders brings](https://github.com/Jarred-Sumner).
- [Astro](https://astro.build/)
  - Astro follows in the footsteps of Static site generators such as Gatsby in the same way school children sometimes step in a T-rex footprint at a museum. I also considered using bare bones [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), but Astro has an [abundance of features](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/why-astro/) that I would have had to hook up myself if using Vite, and as I have gotten older I tend to reach for the more complete solutions first, only reaching for more minute control when truly needed.
- [Stylex](https://stylexjs.com/)
  - I loved the collocation, reusability and composability of [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/), but as [styled components cannot function properly with SSR](https://dev.to/srmagura/why-were-breaking-up-wiht-css-in-js-4g9b) I was forced to chose a newer alternative. Hopefully this Meta project will get more love then [Draft.js](https://github.com/facebookarchive/draft-js)
- [PostHog](https://posthog.com/)
  - I needed an alternative to google analytics, and this seemed like the best option!
- [Font - Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans)
  - I love [variable fonts](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_fonts/Variable_fonts_guide) that are also very accessible!

## TODO

- Add an interactive counter button that increments an "I was here" button, and connects to my planetscale db
