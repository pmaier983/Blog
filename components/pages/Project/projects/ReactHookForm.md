## ‚ùì Why Did I start working on [react-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com/)

My frustration with the performance of [formik](https://formik.org/) under heavy load, combined with my desire to give back to the community and help others is what drove me to start working with [bill](https://github.com/bluebill1049) on react-hook-form.

## üèóÔ∏è How Did I help build [react-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com/)

I started as most OSS contributors start, fixing the docs. If I remember correctly, my first contribution was a german translation of the [README](https://github.com/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/blob/master/docs/README.de-DE.md). This was followed by the enhancement of several codesandbox examples and many documentation enhancements.

Once I had really gotten my hands dirty with react-hook-form I was finally ready to start contributing to the core library. This began with simple bug fixes and progressed to overall feature ideation.

In summary, my proudest accomplishments react-hook-form wise are feature ideation, bug-fixing and countless documentation improvements.

## üí° What Are my takeaways from working on [react-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com/)

Working with others towards a concrete goal is easily one of the fastest ways to learn. Your internal drive compiles with your desire to help and not "let down" your friends. To spin it another way, Open Source (or any project with friends really) is a great way to push yourself.

I learned how to asynchronously work with a team of nearly 10 people. This is a skill you should not overlook! While working at any traditional company you are able to swivel your chair or shoot out a slack message, and you can often get a response within hours. Working with a team scattered across the world & with vastly different time constraints means these strategies are simply not viable anymore.

Now I don't want this post turning into a 1000 line rant about Open Source and its pros/cons, so suffice it to say: "For those with amazing endurance & patience, Open Source can be a great way to have a positive impact!"

TLDR: react-hook-form is awesome, go out into the world and contribute to Open Source!
