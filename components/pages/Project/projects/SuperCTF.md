## ‚ùì Why Did I start working on [SuperCTF.com](https://superctf.com/)

I have a deep love of IO games. I think they fill a difficult niche: You can enjoy them as a game, feel a competitive drive, and avoid severe addiction. Well... most of the time you wont get overly addicted.

I started assisting in the development of [SuperCTF.com](https://superctf.com/) after I went on a two or three day binge and got several characters into the top 10. There is a chance they are still there even after I post this... look for anyone with the name PEDM.

After chatting with Carshall (the founder), I saw joining the team as a great opportunity to get my hands dirty with backend development, specifically in the realm of SQL & webSockets.

## üèóÔ∏è How Did I build [SuperCTF.com](https://superctf.com/)

Just to be entirely clear, this was a team effort. In total there are four of us: Carshall (fullStack), Me (fullStack no Godot), JamJar (Godot), Teho (Art).
