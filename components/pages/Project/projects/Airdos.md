## ‚ùì Why (Did I create Airdos)

- I created Airdos to act as a social media platform for academics. You may be thinking:

  `"why would you build a social media platform Phillip? They are difficult to create and the idea has been mined nearly to its core by companies like Facebook."`

  You my nameless reader are correct ‚úîÔ∏è ! Building a social media site is nearly a clich√© for a young dev, and it is rather difficult to do well. But as Theodore Roosevelt once said [‚ÄúNothing in the world is worth having or worth doing unless it means effort, pain,[and] difficulty"](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/312751-nothing-in-the-world-is-worth-having-or-worth-doing). I was draw to the problem because of how difficult it seemed, and I hoped to learn a tremendous amount as I built (and more likely failed to build) my first social media site.

## üèóÔ∏è How (Did I build Airdos)

- In the interest of brevity, I will simply post a trimmed version of the package.json from the project itself. Keep in my it was a lerna project, so mentally include `{"lerna": "^3.21.0"}`.

## üí° What (Are my takeaways)

- **Plan, plan and plan again, then code**. You know that old adage ["measure twice and cut once"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/measure_twice_and_cut_once), that surprisingly holds some truth when planning a software project. I repeatedly expanded my [MVP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) as I built, leading to a product that was fully built out in some areas, and weirdly lacking in others, without having any obvious core functionality. Moral of the story, build the MVP first, duh ü§¶ .

- **When working with others make sure everyone understands their role and gives feedback freely to everyone they interact with**. I was approached with the idea for Airdos by two friends of mine with no coding experience. Early on we established they would act as product managers and I would be the engineer. For some of you reading this red flags will be flying in every direction, but I was naive... now I'm slightly more mature and also part of a great facebook group called ["I can handle the business side"](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1401833413216649). As it turned out they didn't know how to be product managers at all, and I was too kind/naive to give them the feedback they needed to become better! Always give feedback (in a kind and constructive manner) !
