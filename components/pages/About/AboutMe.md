I'm a ðŸ“š full-stack software engineer. I grew up in [CNY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syracuse,_New_York) and I graduated from [Bowdoin College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowdoin_College) with a double major in Economics and Biochemistry, and a minor in Computer Science.

I am an active participant in the open source community, and am currently one of 7 core maintainers of [react-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com/), the best form library for react with over [+500k](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-hook-form) weekly downloads!
