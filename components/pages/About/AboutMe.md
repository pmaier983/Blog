I'm a 📚&nbsp;&nbsp;full-stack software engineer. I grew up in [CNY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syracuse,_New_York) and I graduated from 🎓&nbsp;&nbsp;[Bowdoin College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowdoin_College) with a double major in Economics and Biochemistry, and a minor in Computer Science.

I am an active participant in the open source community, and am currently one of 7 core maintainers of 📝&nbsp;&nbsp;[react-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com/), the best form library for react with over [+500k](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-hook-form) weekly downloads!

I currently work in Boston at 🏦&nbsp;&nbsp;[State Street](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Street_Corporation) creating and maintaining a marketplace for [MMFs](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/money-marketfund.asp).

I hope you find this site and my musing helpful 😊&nbsp;&nbsp;!
